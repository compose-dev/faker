# Faker

Faker is a pure Node.js library for generating fake data. It's an excellent tool for testing and development, with built-in modules for generating data like names, addresses, phone numbers, and more.

It's inspired by the popular library of the same name, faker.js. We recommend most people continue using that library instead of this one. This library is a smaller, more focused library for use cases specific to Compose.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @composehq/faker

# yarn
yarn add @composehq/faker

# pnpm
pnpm add @composehq/faker
```

## Usage

```js
```
